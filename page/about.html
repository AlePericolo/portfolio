            "Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things.”<br>
            I’m quite a neat guy and I’m not ashamed of it. Yes, I love when things have their own right place. If I don’t finish what I start I don’t fall asleep really easily and if something breaks I can’t just sit and look at the pieces. Trying to fix seems always the best choice to me.<br>
            That’s why writing this presentation was not so easy. Sometimes I didn’t want to start because I knew that I wouldn't be able to finish it, other times matching all the small pieces didn't create a cohesive picture anyway because: "Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear”, and describing themselves is harder that talking about the others ‘cause not only you are closer to the mirror, you are the image in there and it is almost impossible to look at it, at you, from the outside.<br>
            So, let’s start simple. I like running but sometimes the thirty approaching threatening put a strain on my strength. Nothing makes me more happy then a cold beer, a slice of pizza and the wet nose of Leo waiting for me at the door waging his tail.<br>
            Oh, “I hate computers!” No, just kidding, just another quotes and if you have grasp all of it I think that is easy for you to understand that I’m a nerd. I love space, dinosaurs, informatics, '80s, Glenn Cooper, Ernest Cline and Stephen King; technology. Yeah, I see you looking for my profile picture to discover in me some nerd’s “typical esthetic elements” but I’m sorry you will just find the glasses on my nose cause I’m quite atypical. I love travelling and moving around not only sitting in front of a screen. I love swimming in the see, walking all over the mountains, playing football with friends, snowboarding.<br>
            But getting back to the starting point I work as a developer but it’s also one of my passion and I think that being so neat and methodical can help me a bit on it.<br>
            “If only I had more time...” I will tell you that I like cinema, not only the nerd one. I discover the indie production and I really love the editing and the screenwritng process.<br>
            But maybe this is the end or “Wait, a minute, I got all the time I want! I got a time machine!”
